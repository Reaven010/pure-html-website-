            audio not supported by browser
        </audio>
        <ol>
            <li><h2>HTML BoilerPlate</h2>
                <p>
                    this plays a vital role in search engine optimisation as it gives a forward declaration to the browser the the following website follows html 5 format <br>
                    also giving information like language of webpage and character set used in webpage.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>File Path</h2>
                <p>file path plays vital role in linking webpages together and also linking images/videos to web page
                    <br>there are two types of paths
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>absolute path : </b>absolute path is the complete address of a file from a system which access complete pc to get the file <br>
                        which is very dangerous and can cause security issues if not carefull hence by default web browsers block uses of absolute paths</li>
                        <li><b>relative path : </b> this is the path of the file from current location only which can be hosted and hence is relatively safe aas going outside of bounds is not allowed</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>audio and video</h2>
                <p>
                    we can also add audio and video in our html page by using audio and video tags  <br>
                    &lt;audio&gt;<br>
                    &lt;source scr="music.mp4" type="audio/mp4" &gt; <br>
                    &lt;source scr="music.ogg" type="audio/ogg" &gt; <br>
                    audio not supported <br>
                    &lt;/audio&gt; <br>
                    this way of giving is considered optimal way as when giving audio and video in this format our browser will check other files when one of the files is not working<br>
                    similarly video can also be given
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>Div block</h2>
                <p>
                    it is a block level element used to create multiple divisions in  a website which can later be used in grouping them for various purposes like : <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>layout design</li>
                        <li> nesting</li>
                        <li> scripting </li>
                        <li> styling</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> <h2>Class</h2>
            <p>
                 class is a attribute which acts as a specifier for a element it helps us in grouping various elements which are not together and access and modify them simultaniously which can be done using <br>
                 <ul>
                    <li>script</li>
                    <li>style</li>
                 </ul>
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>ID</h2>
                <p>
                    id provides a unique identification to an element as it is a unique attribute there can only be one element with a same id
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
